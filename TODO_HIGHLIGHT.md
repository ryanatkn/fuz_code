# CSS Custom Highlight API Implementation

## Future Work (Phases 2-4)

### Phase 2: Auto-Optimization

- Pattern analysis for optimization opportunities
- Keyword Set conversion for faster matching
- Character class lookup tables
- Compiled pattern caching

### Phase 3: Targeted Optimization

- Specialized scanners for hot paths (strings, comments, numbers)
- Custom scanner functions for complex patterns
- Performance profiling integration

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

- Incremental updates for editing
- Worker pool for large files
- JIT optimization for frequently used patterns
- Runtime pattern optimization

**Target**: 15,000+ ops/sec (5x current)

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Browser bugs**: Extensive testing, maintain fallback
- **Performance regression**: Continuous benchmarking
- **API complexity**: Keep simple API, hide complexity internally
